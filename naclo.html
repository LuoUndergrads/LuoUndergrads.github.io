            <p class="lead">NACLO is a contest for U.S. and Canadian high-school students in which contestants compete by solving compelling and creative puzzles in linguistics and computational linguistics. Participation in NACLO requires no previous knowledge of linguistics, languages, or computing, the puzzles can be solved by analytic reasoning alone, and serve as a fun introduction to a field to which many high school students have not been previously introduced. Winners of NACLO are eligible to compete in the International Linguistics Olympiad, one of the twelve international high school science Olympiads.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">NACLO is currently sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, Google, the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and Cambridge University Press.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">Below is information for previous years of NACLO. Current information can be found <a href="http://www.nacloweb.org/">here</a>.</p>

            <p class="lead">On January 31, 2013, the Computer Science and Engineering Department at University of North Texas will host a local Open Competition site for the North American Computational Linguistics Olympiad (NACLO).</p>

            <p class="lead">The competition will take place at the University of North Texas Research Park, in the College of Engineering, room B155. See <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/site/contact_us">here</a> for complete address and directions. The competition starts at 8:45am, and will end at 12pm. Please plan to arrive 30′ early (i.e., around 8:15am), to allow for the time needed to find the room and sign in.</p>

            <p class="lead">If you are driving and someone is just dropping you off, there is no need to have a visitor parking tag. Just drive past the parking guard house and turn to the left and drop the student off at the front door of the building. Parking will be suspended from 7:30 to 9 am for the drop off and again from 12 to 12:30 for the pick up. If you want to park for the duration of the event, please make sure to stop at the gate to ask for a visitor parking tag. The best place to park is probably the first parking lot in the back. Alternatively, if you ride the UNT bus, you should get off at the stop at the rear of the building. From that back parking lot and bus stop, you should enter the building at the door to the left of the loading docks. Once inside, go up the stairs and then look for the signs for the Computer Science Department. The NACLO registration desk will be right in front of B155.</p>

            <p class="lead">More details about the Olympiad, including the competition rules and practice problems, are available from the central NACLO site. Top scorers in the local Open Competition will be eligible to compete in an Invitational Competition on March 19, 2013. Winners of the Invitational Competition will be eligible to compete in the International Linguistics Olympiad.</p>
            
            <p class="lead"><b>Notes</b>: You should bring black ink pens and pencils. You will have to write the solutions in black ink, and may use pencils only for scratch work. Blank paper can be used for scratch work; however, the final solutions should be copied into the spaces provided in the problem booklet. You may not use any electronic devices except basic wristwatches. In particular, you may not use calculators, computers, palm pilots, cell phones, pagers, or wristwatches with built-in calculators.</p>

            <p class="lead">The <a href="http://www.naclo.cs.cmu.edu/naclo2013handbook.doc">NACLO handbook</a> includes more information about the event. It is a long document, but the information most relevant to you as a participant is mainly on pages 9-15 (the contest rules and an overview of the types of problems to expect).</p>

            <p class="lead">The competition will take place at the University of North Texas, in the MacCafe room in McConnell Hall, 1705 W. Sycamore, Denton, TX 76201. See here for complete address and directions. The competition starts at 8:45am, and will end at 12pm.

            <p class="lead">You can find the UNT parking map here. Parking can be difficult at UNT so it would be best if someone can drop you off and then pick you up later at McConnell Hall. There are parking meters ranging from 2 to 5 hours right in front of McConnell Hall on West Sycamore Street from North Texas Blvd to Avenue C, but there is never any guarantee of parking at a meter. Newcomers to UNT can go to the parking booth at the corner of Avenue C and Chestnut Street to pick up a free visitor’s pass and the guard will tell them where to park. There is a parking garage with hourly parking rates on Welch Street at Union Circle. It is most important that parking signs are followed or you could receive a ticket.</p>
