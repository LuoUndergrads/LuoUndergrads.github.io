The paper makes two important contributions. First, we introduce a novel dataset, consisting of sensorial measurements of human behavior under varied comfort/discomfort conditions. The change in physiological signals of the human body is monitored for several subjects, for different comfort levels in an indoor environment. Second, using the dataset obtained in the first step, we build a model that identifies the relationship between human factors and environmental conditions related to discomfort, with the final goal of automatically predicting the level of discomfort of a building inhabitant without any explicit input from the user. We measure the correlation between sensorial measurements collected from the user and self-reported levels of discomfort, and hence identify the sensorial measurements that are predictive of human discomfort.

This human-centered discomfort prediction model is expected to enable innovative adaptive control scenarios for a built environment in real time, as well as a significant reduction in building energy usage directly related to human occupancy and their desired comfort levels.",LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among all available modalities, we focus on three modalities namely, language use, physiological response, and thermal sensing. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate these specific modalities to detect deceit. Several experiments are carried out in which we first select representative features for each modality, and then we analyze joint models that integrate several modalities. The experimental results show that the combination of features from different modalities significantly improves the detection of deceptive behaviors as compared to the use of one modality at a time. Moreover, the use of non-contact modalities proved to be comparable with and sometimes better than existing contact-based methods. The proposed method increases the efficiency of detecting deceit by avoiding human involvement in an attempt to move towards a completely automated non-invasive deception detection process.

2012,Sense and Reference Disambiguation in Wikipedia,"Hui Shen, Razvan C. Bunescu, Rada Mihalcea","24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING), Poster, 2012",http://www.anthology.aclweb.org/C/C12/C12-2108.pdf,"Word Sense Disambiguation, MuSeNet",,,,,"Wikipedia articles are annotated by volunteer contributors with numerous links that connect words and phrases to relevant titles in Wikipedia. In this paper, we identify inconsistencies in the user annotation of links and show that they can have a substantial impact on the performance of word sense disambiguation systems that are trained on Wikipedia links. We describe two major types of link annotations – <i>sense</i> and <i>reference</i> – that are frequently used without being explicitly distinguished in Wikipedia, and present an approach to training sense and reference disambiguation systems in the presence of such annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that accounting for annotation ambiguity in Wikipedia links leads to significant improvements in disambiguation accuracy",LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2012,Multilingual Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis,"Rada Mihalcea, Carmen Banea, Janyce Wiebe","Tutorial Abstracts of ACL, 2012",http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P12/P12-4004.pdf,Sentiment Analysis,,,,,"Subjectivity and sentiment analysis focuses on the automatic identification of private states, such as opinions, emotions, sentiments, evaluations, beliefs, and speculations in natural language. While subjectivity classification labels text as either subjective or objective, sentiment classification adds an additional level of granularity, by further classifying subjective text as either positive, negative or neutral.
 </br>
While much of the research work in this area has been applied to English, research on other languages is growing, including Japanese, Chinese, German, Spanish, Romanian. While most of the researchers in the field are familiar with the methods applied on English, few of them have closely looked at the original research carried out in other languages. For example, in languages such as Chinese, researchers have been looking at the ability of characters to carry sentiment information (Ku et al., 2005; Xiang, 2011). In Romanian, due to markers of politeness and additional verbal modes embedded in the language, experiments have hinted that subjectivity detection may be easier to achieve (Banea et al., 2008). These additional sources of information may not be available across all languages, yet, various articles have pointed out that by investigating a synergistic approach for detecting subjectivity and sentiment in multiple languages at the same time, improvements can be achieved not only in other languages, but in English as well. The development and interest in these methods is also highly motivated by the fact that only 27% of Internet users speak English (www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm, Oct 11, 2011), and that number diminishes further every year, as more people across the globe gain Internet access.
 </br>
The aim of this tutorial is to familiarize the attendees with the subjectivity and sentiment research carried out on languages other than English in order to enable and promote cross-fertilization. Specifically, we will review work along three main directions. First, we will present methods where the resources and tools have been specifically developed for a given target language. In this category, we will also briefly overview the main methods that have been proposed for English, but which can be easily ported to other languages. Second, we will describe cross-lingual approaches, including several methods that have been proposed to leverage on the resources and tools available in English by using cross-lingual projections. Finally, third, we will show how the expression of opinions and polarity pervades language boundaries, and thus methods that holistically explore multiple languages at the same time can be effectively considered.",LIT,FALSE,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For word sense discrimination, we build context vectors, which are clustered, from the word representations based on the extended compositional model. For word sense disambiguation, we augment lexical features with their word representations based on the same extended compositional model.
